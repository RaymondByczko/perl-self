The light website offers processing of JPG images.
It offers a variety of services to do various operations.

one-to-many increasing threshold
--------------------------------

One functionality is to take a JPG and adjust a color component,
say red, to produce a series of JPGs.  The adjustment will involve
setting the color component of interest to some preset value.
The adjustment is for all pixels above a certain threshold.  The threshold
goes from some start value to some end value, with each value of threshold
producing its own JPG image.  The number of JPGs produced is equal
to: (end value - start value + 1).

The start
value is between 0 and 255.  The same range applies to the end
value, except the start value must be less than the end value.

The amount of increase

So this is how it works.  Do the following for each value of
threshold from start to end. Take the original JPG and do an x,y scan, noting
each pixel were the color component is at or above the current threshold.
Reset that pix such that the color component is the preset value.  Do for
all applicable pixels.  This produces a new JPG.  It can be named
original.<start>.jpg

Consider then the next value of threshold, calling it the current
threshold.  Do the same scan against the original, peforming the comparison, which will indicate
applicable pixels.  Again a new JPG is produced, which can be named
original.<start + 1>.jpg. 

Using the same process, the last jpg to be produced by this process is
original.<end>.jpg.

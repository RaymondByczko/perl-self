This directory contains tests for figuring out and learning
prototypes in Perl 5.
	* test_prototype01.pl - this perl file checks out with
	'perl -c'.  However, run it with just 'perl' and notice
	the run-time error that occurs.
	* test_prototype01b.pl - this is a close cousin file to
	test_prototype01.pl.  However, it changes one sub by
	not assigning the array ref to an array.  Like its
	relative, see what 'perl -c' produces for this file.
	And then, check it out at run time with 'perl'.

	* By doing the above for the two files indicated, you
	will see how perls parser is modified with prototypes.
	* Advice: do a 'diff' between test_prototype01.pl
	and test_prototype01b.pl .
	* Summary: \@ will convert a supplied array supplied
	as, for example, @fruit_array, to a reference.  Its done
	by the parser and not actively by the client code. Cool!

Some other tests for learning Perl 5.

	* test_prototype03.pl - explore the use of prototypes
	and the difference between handing a prototyped sub
	a) an array b) a reference to an array c) a reference
	to an array that is dereferenced as an array. Case a
	and case c work fine.  Case B generates compile error.
	(Use 'perl -c') The error causing perl code is
	clearly indicated with @COMP_ERROR_CAUSE.

	* test_prototype02.pl - to explore the use of prototypes
	and how they are called the old fashioned and new
	fashioned ways.
